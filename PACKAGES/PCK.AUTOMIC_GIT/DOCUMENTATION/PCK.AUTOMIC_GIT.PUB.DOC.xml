However, it has to be noted that the credentials are passed as part of the URL, which will be stored in git repository configuration as plain text. Also, if the authentication fails, an error message containing the URL will be visible in the report.
URL has syntax https://<username>:<password>@github.com/username/repository.git, it has to be noted that "@" character is not allowed in username or password.
